## Abstract
The Arisen software introduces a new architecture for building decentralized applications that are able to truly operate at global scale. Arisen is an early fork of the EOS.IO blockchain software with a different vision for a decentralized web, that utilizes both on-chain and off-chain protocols, in order to achieve true end-to-end decentralization for the decentralized applications built upon it. The dweb:// protocol and many of dWeb's off-chain components like dDrive (like IPFS & Swarm), dAppDB (a decentralized database management system) and dMemo (like Whisper) are ultimately teamed with Arisen's ability to provide accounts, authentication, user permissions, asynchronous communication, application logic, peer-to-peer (P2P) payments and a powerful on-chain decentralized domain name system that is all governed by a decentralized democracy. This results in a platform where developers can build dApps (decentralized applications) at global scale as of today, on a network that can truly span the world. Thanks to Arisen's ability to interoperate with other EOS.IO-based blockchains and its integration with dWeb's decentralized and globally elastic network, a fully decentralized web that can support billions of users is no longer a dream. It has Arisen.

## Background
Blockchain technology has advanced so much over the past decade that Dr. Gavin Wood aptly coined the term "Web3", when Ethereum was widely considered to be the third iteration of the worldwide web (www). While Ethereum gave life to what many thought were the world's first dApps (decentralized applications), Dr. Wood correctly states in his book "Mastering Ethereum", that "in the Ethereum ecosystem as it stands today, there are very few truly decentralized applications -- most still rely on centralized services and servers for some part of their operations. In the future we expect that it will be possible for every part of any dApp to be operated in a fully decentralized way" [1]. Dr. Wood is right, that a majority of the applications that operate on blockchains like Ethereum and EOS, have many central points of failure. These central points of failure include centralized servers that can experience DOS (denial of service) attacks via malicious actors or can even be seized by tyrannical companies and/or governments. The same can be said about the top-level domains (TLDs) that are utilized by users when accessing these applications through a web browser. These TLDs, like the "cryptokitties.com" TLD, can also be seized by tyrannical companies and/or governments or taken away for policy violations by domain registrars, as was seen in the public debacle surrounding the "gab.com" TLD.

Another issue seen with Ethereum, as well as EOS is their inability to store large datasets. This is due to smart contract not being well suited for storing or processing large amounts of data [2]. To deal with this issue, Ethereum and EOS dApp developers use off-chain storage services like IPFS or Ethereum's Swarm, also referred to as a decentralized content-addressable storage system (dCass), so developers can store HTML, JS, CSS and other files related to their websites and/or applications on a peer-to-peer network [3]. Although, these off-chain storage services are not designed to deal with what would typically be referred to as the data layer of an application, where there is some sort of DBMS (Database Management System), so that data can be stored or queried [4] and in some cases, as it applies to immutable applications, updated or deleted. As a result, dApps are forced to store all data and event-based transactions that are generated from a decentralized application, on-chain. This causes a blockchain that has a 5-10K transaction/ps capacity, to become overloaded, where its true purpose of handling application logic and payment functionality are slowed to an extent where the blockchain itself becomes useless or slow, dApps on the network are slowed to a point where they're no longer usable and payments take an average of thirty minutes or even an hour to verify over the network.

The Arisen blockchain solves these issues with off-chain interoperability with the dWeb protocol (dweb://) and many dWeb-based off-chain components. These components include a decentralized content-addressable storage system (dCass), a decentralized application messaging protocol (dAmp), a decentralized domain name system (dDNS) and a decentralized database management system (dDBMS). dWeb's dDrive, dNames, dDatabase, dAppDB and dMemo components, when combined with Arisen's blockchain platform, create a completely decentralized environment for websites and applications where the following solutions are combined into one cohesive toolset:

- Decentralized and autonomous on-chain application logic and payment functionality (Smart contract framework)
- Decentralized off-chain top-level domain names (dTLDs like .dcom, .dnet, .dweb, etc.)
- Decentralized off-chain web address resolution (dWeb keys / dWeb resolver)
- Decentralized on-chain user authentication / permissions (Arisen accounts)
- Decentralized off-chain application-to-application or application instance to application instance messaging (dMemo)
- Decentralized off-chain database management systems (dDatabase, dAppDB and dSiteDB)
- Decentralized off-chain content-addressable storage for web/application files (HTML, JS, CSS, media, etc)

The above issues related to Web 3.0 allow for companies and bad actors within government who want to slow the oncoming threat of decentralization, the ability to do so, by seizing or attacking semi-decentralized applications at various central points of failure whether it's by seizing domain names or servers that handle various services for these applications. Decentralized applications and websites bring life back to the web, eliminating the need to use technologies from big tech companies that want to force the general populous to abide by their belief systems and unconstitutional policies [6]. Fully decentralized social networks for example, would be unable to interfere with US-based elections like Google, Facebook, Twitter and other centralized social networks have on a consistent basis, allowing users of the decentralized social network to follow what they want see, minus the political control mechanisms typically exercised over users of a centralized social network and search engine application. It also keeps tyrannical companies and governments from having the power to affect the uptime of these decentralized applications, considering they're distributed amongst millions or billions of peers, without a single central point of failure.

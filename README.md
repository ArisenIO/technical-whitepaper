## Abstract
The Arisen software introduces a new architecture for building decentralized applications that are able to truly operate at global scale. Arisen is an early fork of the EOS.IO blockchain software with a different vision for a decentralized web, that utilizes both on-chain and off-chain protocols, in order to achieve true end-to-end decentralization for the decentralized applications built upon it. The dweb:// protocol and many of dWeb's off-chain components like dDrive (like IPFS & Swarm), dAppDB (a decentralized database management system) and dMemo (like Whisper) are ultimately teamed with Arisen's ability to provide accounts, authentication, user permissions, asynchronous communication, application logic, peer-to-peer (P2P) payments and a powerful on-chain decentralized domain name system that is all governed by a decentralized democracy. This results in a platform where developers can build dApps (decentralized applications) at global scale as of today, on a network that can truly span the world. Thanks to Arisen's ability to interoperate with other EOS.IO-based blockchains and its integration with dWeb's decentralized and globally elastic network, a fully decentralized web that can support billions of users is no longer a dream. It has Arisen.

## Background
Blockchain technology has advanced so much over the past decade that Dr. Gavin Wood aptly coined the term "Web3", when Ethereum was widely considered to be the third iteration of the worldwide web (www). While Ethereum gave life to what many thought were the world's first dApps (decentralized applications), Dr. Wood correctly states in his book "Mastering Ethereum", that "in the Ethereum ecosystem as it stands today, there are very few truly decentralized applications -- most still rely on centralized services and servers for some part of their operations. In the future we expect that it will be possible for every part of any dApp to be operated in a fully decentralized way" [1]. Dr. Wood is right, that a majority of the applications that operate on blockchains like Ethereum and EOS, have many central points of failure. These central points of failure include centralized servers that can experience DOS (denial of service) attacks via malicious actors or can even be seized by tyrannical companies and/or governments. The same can be said about the top-level domains (TLDs) that are utilized by users when accessing these applications through a web browser. These TLDs, like the "cryptokitties.com" TLD, can also be seized by tyrannical companies and/or governments or taken away for policy violations by domain registrars, as was seen in the public debacle surrounding the "gab.com" TLD.

Another issue seen with Ethereum, as well as EOS is their inability to store large datasets. This is due to smart contract not being well suited for storing or processing large amounts of data [2]. To deal with this issue, Ethereum and EOS dApp developers use off-chain storage services like IPFS or Ethereum's Swarm, also referred to as a decentralized content-addressable storage system (dCass), so developers can store HTML, JS, CSS and other files related to their websites and/or applications on a peer-to-peer network [3]. Although, these off-chain storage services are not designed to deal with what would typically be referred to as the data layer of an application, where there is some sort of DBMS (Database Management System), so that data can be stored or queried [4] and in some cases, as it applies to immutable applications, updated or deleted. As a result, dApps are forced to store all data and event-based transactions that are generated from a decentralized application, on-chain. This causes a blockchain that has a 5-10K transaction/ps capacity, to become overloaded, where its true purpose of handling application logic and payment functionality are slowed to an extent where the blockchain itself becomes useless or slow, dApps on the network are slowed to a point where they're no longer usable and payments take an average of thirty minutes or even an hour to verify over the network.

The Arisen blockchain solves these issues with off-chain interoperability with the dWeb protocol (dweb://) and many dWeb-based off-chain components. These components include a decentralized content-addressable storage system (dCass), a decentralized application messaging protocol (dAmp), a decentralized domain name system (dDNS) and a decentralized database management system (dDBMS). dWeb's dDrive, dNames, dDatabase, dAppDB and dMemo components, when combined with Arisen's blockchain platform, create a completely decentralized environment for websites and applications where the following solutions are combined into one cohesive toolset:

- Decentralized and autonomous on-chain application logic and payment functionality (Smart contract framework)
- Decentralized off-chain top-level domain names (dTLDs like .dcom, .dnet, .dweb, etc.)
- Decentralized off-chain web address resolution (dWeb keys / dWeb resolver)
- Decentralized on-chain user authentication / permissions (Arisen accounts)
- Decentralized off-chain application-to-application or application instance to application instance messaging (dMemo)
- Decentralized off-chain database management systems (dDatabase, dAppDB and dSiteDB)
- Decentralized off-chain content-addressable storage for web/application files (HTML, JS, CSS, media, etc)

The above issues related to Web 3.0 allow for companies and bad actors within government who want to slow the oncoming threat of decentralization, the ability to do so, by seizing or attacking semi-decentralized applications at various central points of failure whether it's by seizing domain names or servers that handle various services for these applications. Decentralized applications and websites bring life back to the web, eliminating the need to use technologies from big tech companies that want to force the general populous to abide by their belief systems and unconstitutional policies [6]. Fully decentralized social networks for example, would be unable to interfere with US-based elections like Google, Facebook, Twitter and other centralized social networks have on a consistent basis, allowing users of the decentralized social network to follow what they want see, minus the political control mechanisms typically exercised over users of a centralized social network and search engine application. It also keeps tyrannical companies and governments from having the power to affect the uptime of these decentralized applications, considering they're distributed amongst millions or billions of peers, without a single central point of failure.

## How We're Going To Decentralize The World
The following is required for web applications to be fully decentralized, globally scalable and capable of gaining widespread adoption:

### Support Infinite Users Through Global Scalability
In order to compete with major centralized companies, a network like Arisen must be able to operate at global scale, without a single central point of failure. dWeb's protocol and Arisen's network are globally elastic, Arisen's off-chain services like dDrive and dAppDB are capable of storing millions of datasets within each instance, teamed with Arisen's ability to handle thousands of payments on a per-second basis, the creation of millions of daily on-chain accounts, along with the processing of millions of smart contract-based requests from integrated applications, gives way to a platform that can effectively support the requests of billions of users. This is because 90% of the network's events take place off-chain, between peers on a network that has a nearly infinite capacity, due to the fact that Arisen's off-chain P2P networks and their capacity only grow larger, the more users who join onto it, ultimately giving it global scalability. dApps that are built for mainstream usage could gain widespread adoption and Arisen's on-chain and off-chain integrations are clearly capable of taking on this sort of growth.

### Decentralized Web Protocol
The dWeb protocol is designed for syncing folders that typically contain websites and web applications, along with the data that's usually associated with their usage, between peers on a decentralized peer-to-peer network, even if these folders are substantial in size or frequently updated. Synced and distributed folders over the protocol are referred to as dWeb repositories or dPacks for short. dWeb's protocol utilizes a cryptographically secure log of updates to validate whether or not a dPack is truly distributed. A byte range of a file's version can be efficiently broadcasted via a dWeb-based repository to other peers, utilizing the dWeb protocol, from any network connection. dWeb's protocol uses public key cryptography to encrypt all traffic over a dWeb-based network like Arisen. A dWeb peer-to-peer network is essentially a group of peers, also referred to as a "flock", that ultimately connect with each other to exchange dPacks, can be established as a public or private network and an infinite number of networks can co-exist at once, utilizing the same protocol. In short, dWeb is a website, web application and dataset (dPack)  synchronization protocol, that ultimately synchronizes these websites, web applications and datasets between a group of peers, on a peer-to-peer network. dWeb is essentially a torrent-like network, for websites, web applications and datasets.

### High Performance
Both on-chain and off-chain, Arisen's focus on high performance separates it from other blockchain projects. Thanks to the work by block.one on the EOS.IO software, the combination of Arisen and dWeb's protocol, brings about one of the most powerful networks in the industry.

Arisen and its off-chain services, are capable of:

**Arisen**
-- 120 blocks per-minute (one block per 0.5 second).
-- 4,500 transactions per-second (270,000 per minute).

**dWeb/Off-Chain Services**
-- Can support billions of peers over the same network.
-- Over 1,000,000 files and folders in one single dDrive instance.
-- The dWeb can hold as many dDrives and dPacks as the peers of the network require it to.
-- There are so many possible dWeb addresses, it would take millions of years to use them all.

### Low Latency
The Arisen blockchain software and related components are built to support the low latency of P2P communications and transactions, whether on-chain or off-chain. In order for decentralized applications to operate smoothly and deliver a user-experience that is worthy of widespread adoption, they should be built around P2P platforms that have low or very little latency.

### End-To-End Decentralization
Most decentralized applications (dApps) that refer to themselves as dApps are not completely decentralized from end-to-end. Arisen and dWeb's on/off chain protocols allow for decentralized applications that utilize them, to maintain end-to-end decentralization, to where these dApps or decentralized websites (dSites) cannot be seized, taken offline or exploited for a central point of failure. Nor can they be hacked or experience DOS-like attacks, due to their existence amongst distributed peers, rather than on centralized networks.

### Sequential & Parallel Performance
Some dApps, like a decentralized exchange such as BitShares, cannot be developed using parallel algorithms, instead, they require fast sequential performance, due to them being reliant upon sequential steps. Applications such as a decentralized exchange require sequential performance to handle high volumes, while other dApps require parallel performance where the application logic needed by the application(s) requires a workload across multiple CPUs and computers. Arisen provides both sequential and parallel performance. 

### P2P Messaging Protocol
A major component of any application is interprocess communication. In other words, applications should be able to send messages between each other, between different instances of an application or between the users of an application. Arisen's off-chain "dMemo" protocol, allows for dApp developers to utilize interprocess communication completely off-chain. 

### Content-Addressability 
The centralized web utilizes IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6) for the addressing of network content across the worldwide web. Being that IPs are ultimately controlled by central governments and companies, using IP addresses to address content on the decentralized web wouldn't work, nor would it make sense. This is because content is hosted amongst peers, rather than on servers within centralized data centers. On the dWeb, all content (folders, files, databases, etc.) is addressable by Ed25519 public keys (32 bytes and 64 characters when Hex encoded) and can easily be accessed through many different methods over the dweb:// protocol (like a dWeb-enabled web browser).

### Off-Chain Database Management System
Arisen is integrated with several off-chain, decentralized, database management systems (dDBMS), built on the "dDatabase" protocol, like dAppDB and dSiteDB. These databases are shared between peers on the peer-to-peer web and addressable by Ed25519 public keys. Both dAppDB and dSiteDB have JavaScript-based APIs, allowing data entries to be added, retrieved, deleted and "listed". dAppDB and dSiteDB are essentially dDatabase-based append-only feeds at their very core. dDBMS frameworks allow dApp developers to place a majority of their data that's not utilized by on-chain code (smart contracts), completely off-chain. This takes a great load off the blockchain and decreases the size of a blockchain's global state, drastically.

### Decentralized Domain Name System (dDNS)
While content on the decentralized web can certainly be accessed via dWeb-based cryptographic keys, these 64 character keys are too hard to remember by users of public, highly trafficked websites and applications, just like IP addresses are on the centralized web. The Arisen network brings to life human-readable network identifiers also known as dTLDs (decentralized top-level domains) like .dcom, .dnet, .dorg, etc. dTLD extensions (like *.dcom) can be created and auctioned off to the highest bidder on the network, while individual domains can be purchased from decentralized registrars like dNames. Anyone can become a registrar on the network, creating great competition around the sale of dTLDs. 

### File Versioning 
When uploading a new version of a website or an application to the peer-to-peer web, the dWeb protocol is designed to use a sorted, depth-first recursion to list all the files in a file system tree. For each file the protocol finds, it fetches the filesystem metadata (filename, Stat Object, etc) and performs a check if a filename with the precise metadata exists. File versioning and repository versioning is very important, especially since peers may be looking for previous versions of a website or a dApp. Considering dApps & dSites on the Arisen network are held within "distributed repositories", it's important that dApps and dSites maintain version control, just as GIT-based repositories do on the centralized web. It's important to note that all dSites and dApps that are publicly shared, automatically become open-sourced and can be "forked" (cloned) by anyone who wants to do so. The transparent nature of websites and applications on the Arisen network, allows for consumers to insure that there aren't any back doors or implementations that violate user privacy.

### P2P Payments
Arisen's blockchain, like all other blockchains, acts as a P2P payments network. The economic features of Arisen's network allow for dApps to enable users to earn and spend within a decentralized ecosystem, without a single central entity who can possibly interrupt this P2P process. Many great payment-based solutions like dPay and aBank are already being built on top of the Arisen network as payment solutions for dApps.

### Server-less Network
Due to the way websites and web applications distributed via dPacks and/or dDrives are exchanged between peers over a network, instead of being shared via a centralized server, the need for web hosting has been eliminated. Developing websites or web applications with programming languages like PHP, which only works alongside centralized DBMS's, are only designed to develop applications based around a centralized architecture. This is why Arisen's off-chain services embrace the JavaScript programming language and all current DBMS's designed for the Arisen network are written in JavaScript. This allows developers to build "host-less" or "server-less" websites or web applications that scale to the global resources of the network, without a single central point of failure, as long as dTLDs are used for resolving websites and web applications, rather than centralized TLDs that can be seized or lost. 

### Decentralized Democracy 
Many people say cryptocurrencies enable people to fund terrorism, buy/sell drugs and give way to many other illicit activities. It will also be said that malicious actors will use Arisen's network to host illegal pornography and that the dWeb protocol will be used for various forms of illicit activities as well. These are all true statements. Cryptocurrencies ARE used to fund every possible illicit activity you can think of -- and so are government-issued currencies. Bad actors will also find Arisen and will immediately see it as a place to carry out various forms of illicit activities, just as they do on the centralized web every day. 

So the question is, how do we keep the decentralized web safe? We The People, are supposed to be in charge of the country we live in, based around the idea that we elect the officials who are truly in charge of making decisions on our behalf. The problem is, these elected officials are funded by special interest groups, who invest in these government official's ability to protect them, over the needs of the people who elected them. It takes voters years to change their vote since they're forced to wait until the next election to vote on a new candidate, on top of the fact that there is no way to prove if the election results were rigged or actually authentic in the first place. 

Arisen's network brings to life a truly decentralized democracy, that is legitimately controlled by the people of the network. This decentralized, sovereign democracy is based around a continuously running election of 21 "governance" candidates, who have the vested power by way of a majority vote, to freeze accounts, suspend domains, blacklist dWeb addresses, approve community-funded projects, reverse transactions and more. If governance members abuse their power in these situations, the members of the network can instantly switch their vote to a new candidate. Voting statistics on the network are completely authentic and cannot be manipulated due to the network's immutable state. This allows the people themselves to police the network and expand the ecosystem that works for them, the way they want to, without the long-term sufferings brought on by special interest groups, election interference or dishonest political candidates.
